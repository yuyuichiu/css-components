9/5/2021 - Search Widget
** Concept **
> To create two-side expand effect, just expand both item. (one by width, another by transform: translate(_); )
** Javascript **
> classList.toggle()
---- easier way to add & remove a class like an on/off button
> myInput.focus()
---- to focus on the input, enable immediate typing.



7/5/2021 - Rotating Nav Menu
** CSS **
> Dynamic CSS trick
---- if there is an active class that is added by javascript, we can modify other behavior on css instead of in js one by one
---- ".container.active ~ .target" to toggle two states
---- "+" means next siblings && "~" means general siblings
(siblings means two elements are on the same level.)
<< it auto focuses on adjusted items so it fixes some scrolling issues too >>

> A semi-circle on corner of screen
---- Put a circle in a container, and container set to fixed position with -100px on top and left
---- The circle will be partly hidden, making an illusion of a quarter circle.
> Customizing button -- clear out default button properties
---- 1. background: transparent;
---- 2. border: none;
---- 3. button:focus { outline: none; }
> Responsive margin
---- Combine "margin" & "max-width" to ensure minimum margin, without weird display on wide screens.
(Content need to put on separate div for this to work, cannot do this directly to body)



6/5/2021 - Progress step component
** CSS **
> ::before & ::after
---- as if adding HTML block above/below current element
---- but only does visual appearance, avoid confusing html codes
---- Show its content by "content: '';"
> align-items vs. justify-content
---- align item controls the minor axis, the up and down
---- justify-content controls the major axis, the left and right
> CSS variables
---- :root{ --varName: value; }
---- var name always starts with "--" & stored inside :root{} at top
> Button click effect
---- scale(0.97) [not too stylish, and express the 'clicked' message]
---- set "outline: 0" in :focus for best visuals
> "flex: 1" will disrupt text alignment

** Javascript **
> Turn on disabled by "element.disabled = true/false"



5/5/2021 - Expanding Cards
** CSS Background **
> background-position: center 
---- keep picture to center of container
> background-size: x, y 
---- control background img

** Javascript **
> querySelector("myclass")
----to select classes similar to getElementsByClassName();
After selected element, we can edit its class by
> classList.add() | .remove()
----edit what class get attached to elements
(Seems like javascript cannot modify class content directly)
